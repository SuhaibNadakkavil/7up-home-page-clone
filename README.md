✅ Project Title: 7UP Homepage UI Clone
Time Period: April 2025

Project URL: https://7up-home-page.vercel.app/

Associated With: Brototype – Brocamp

Description:
This was my fourth overall project and my first project after entering Brototype’s 7-month offline program (Brocamp) at the Hub in Kozhikode. The goal was to sharpen my frontend fundamentals using only HTML and CSS by recreating the homepage of the official 7UP website.
Before building, I studied layout structures using W3Schools and then crafted the entire page from scratch — no frameworks or copied code. It helped me develop a strong eye for UI alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy. This project gave me confidence in building attractive and responsive designs with just the basics.

GitHub for version control

Deployed on Vercel
